# CSCE 451 Final Project

This repository contains the work for the **14-VTTF** reversing team consisting of *Vicente Tovar-Marquez* and *Terrell Ford*.

The [src](./src) directory contains the reversed source code that we've derived from the binary.

The [ghidra](./ghidra) directory contains both the original (original.bin) and working modified binary (working.bin). It also includes the Ghidra export file that we have exported from Ghidra (ghidra_exp.gzf). That file can be imported into your local Ghidra program to see all the modifications and renaming that we have done on the binary.
